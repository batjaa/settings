# Batjaa's dotfiles

1. Use Safari to add your SSH keys to github. Clone the repository. In macos terminal simply `bash` will do.

1. To update, `cd` into your local `dotfiles` repository and then (remember to use bash):

```bash
source bootstrap.sh
```

Alternatively, to update while avoiding the confirmation prompt:

```bash
set -- -f; source bootstrap.sh
```
